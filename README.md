The kick-ass email framework
=======================

For now, this is meant to be a quick and easy framework for rapidly prototyping responsive, HTML emails.

Because HTML emails need  (in most cases) inline styles and table-based layouts, this is not currently a system that will let you actually build emails.

That's a long-term goal, of course, but we could be talking seriously, seriously long term.
